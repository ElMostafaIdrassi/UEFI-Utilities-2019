# UEFI-Utilities-2019

Various UEFI utilities built against UDK2018 using Clang.

To integrate into UDK2018 source tree:

Create a subdirectory immediately under UDK2018 called MyApps, populate MyApps with one or more of the utilities, fix up MyApps.dsc to build the required utility or utilities by uncommenting one or more .inf lines.

Note these utilities have only been built and tested on an Lenovo T480 X64 platform.

I now include a 64-bit EFI binary of each utility in each utility subdirectory.

See http://blog.fpmurphy.com for detailed information about the utilities.
